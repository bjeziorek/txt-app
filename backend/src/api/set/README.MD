# API Set



There will be 2 types of create set.
- Create existing set - can be created only from predefined sets. This feature will be avilable from the very first version of this application a basic functionallity.
- Create new set - this feature is planned for future versions and will let user design their own sets and their schemas, but creating schemas require some extra desingin how to do it in architecture. Maybe both these features will be merged in future but at the moment I keep them separated to make code self-explaining what is does.
