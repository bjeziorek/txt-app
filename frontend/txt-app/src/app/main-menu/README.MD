# Main menu component

It doesn't really make sense, beacuse it's not clean what menu component is responsible and what main menu is...

It should be renamed. Maybe to setMenu?

It requires better design.

## Current responsibility
It lists hard-coded novel template tabs.

## Desired responsibility
It should get from server list of sets and dynamically generate buttons with right component.

It definietly requires further designinig.
