To remove. (Propably)

This component will be replaced by dynamic set-data.

But this file is quite complex. I need to rethinnk if I want that much place in set-data. Maybe it's easilly generatable from provided json but maybe not. We shall see.

But definietly name shoud match set's name. Now it doesn't.
